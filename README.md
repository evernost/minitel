# The Minitel Project
The _Minitel_ is the French response to the rise of the Internet network. 

It used to operate on a classic landline network, although the service has long since been discontinued.

Fortunately, they have a sort of UART connectivity that can be used to turn the Minitel into an old-school terminal, with some elementary graphical possibilities.

In this project, I want to explore this UART port some more and develop:
- the hardware interface to plug it to any recent computer
- the software interface to make interaction with the Minitel smoother.
